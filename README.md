# SheetToFirebase
  As we know Firebase is a non-relational database so if we have a bulk amount of data on the relational form then it is difficult to manually enter the data to the firebase.

  So to enter this bulk data to firebase, we can use google sheet API where we store the relational data and we can fetch the data from it and then can upload it into the firebase as needed.
